# Soft-475-Overclock
Based on the discovery and code from Mustermann that it is possible to change the clock speed of the LC 475 and similar Macintosh computers, from software alone. This project is a user controllable extension that enables you to set the clock speed of your LC 475, such that the clock speed is automatically configured during boot.
